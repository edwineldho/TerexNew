Read every line which is required
Specification array is the array which contains the values like [Price Level, Data Version...]


For each line
	If Data code is present || if line is present in specification array then append line as an element to an array
        Else join line with previous line element
# Now every line has been combined into one line
For each line
   If line in Specification array then assign then GLOBAL spec = line, break
   Else:  
   	Extract Datacode using pattern xxx_xxx
   	Until a "double whitespace" is encountered, everything else is considered description, extract accordingly
   	If double whitespace encountered then replace it with a comma, then subsequent white space with another comma #This would take the first number as the front, and the subsequent number as the rear weights. They are separated by whitespace. 
	

You don't even need to extract anything. All you have to do is add a comma between the extraction points. CSV file automatically created...
Then it is easy to convert from CSV to Excel

Other tasks which need to be done

1.
 Have to make sure that the lines which are present are only required. Read techniques need to be studied
2. Once all parts identified, how do you append it to a CSV file
2. 


Function to detect/extraction data code pattern

1. Extract the first 9 characters in 1 line
2. Use RegEx to pattern match according to *xxx_xxx* 
* is a white space
